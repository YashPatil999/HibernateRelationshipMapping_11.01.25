1.One-to-One Relationship:

A one-to-one relationship exists when one entity is associated with exactly one instance of another entity.

2.One-to-Many Relationship

A one-to-many relationship exists when one entity is associated with multiple instances of another entity.

3.Many-to-One Relationship

A many-to-one relationship exists when multiple instances of one entity are associated with one instance of another entity.
